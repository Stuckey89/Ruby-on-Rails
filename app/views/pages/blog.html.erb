            <p>I didn't choose to be a programmer. Somehow, it seemed, the computers chose me. For a long time, that was fine, that was enough; that was all I needed. But along the way I never felt that being a programmer was this unambiguously great-for-everyone career field with zero downsides.</p>

            <p>I've said many, many times that the key to becoming an experienced software developer is to understand that you are, at all times, your own worst enemy. I don't mean this in a negative way - you have to constantly plan for and design around your inevitable human mistakes and fallibility.</p>

              <p>Q: What do you love most about coding?
              A: Software is easy to change to make it better, and software can also encourage people to do better things and help others.</p>

            <p><em> In attempting to simplify my answers for an audience of kids,<em> I had concisely articulated the one thing that keeps me coming back to software:</em> to serve man. Not on a platter for monetezation - but software that helps people be the best version of themselves. </em></p>

            <p><em>“A common misconception about developers is that they’ve all been programming since childhood. In fact, we see a wide range of experience levels. Among professional developers, one-eighth (12.5%) learned to code less than four years ago, and an additional one-eighth (13.3%) learned to code between four and six years ago. Due to the pervasiveness of online courses and coding bootcamps, adults with little to no programming experience can now more easily transition to a career as a developer.”</em></p>


            
            <p>I believe that working as a developer challenges you mentally and also challenges you creatively. It allows you to help people by bringing their vision to life whether it be through a web design, or a mobile application. 
            Here are a few reasons why I love being a developer.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I'm never micromanaged and I'm trusted to get things done efficiently.</li>
              <li>I can use my best judgment on what language best fits clients needs.</li>
              <li>My team always challenges me to use new concepts and design.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here are three fun facts that you may not have known about developers.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Developers are slow to ask for help when facing problems.</li>
              <li>Peer code review can discover up to 60% of bugs.</li>
              <li>Programmers seek other forms of help before consulting with coworkers.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>All in all I believe that developing is the perfect job for anyone who is willing to take the time and learn.</p>
